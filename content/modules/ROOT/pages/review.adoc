== Review

Hopefully you learned a few things on how to achive business continuity on Red Hat OpenShift Platform through this lab.

Disaster Recovery features supported by Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation require all of the following prerequisites in order to successfully implement a Disaster Recovery solution:

* A valid Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Advanced entitlement
* A valid Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes subscription

Thank you!
