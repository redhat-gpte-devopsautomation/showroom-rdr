== OnBoard a sample application and make it DR Ready. Test

=== Task Goal

==== Now you know how the Regional DR works and how you can achieve Business Continuity using Regional DR for your application.
Lets puts this learning to action now and configure a sample application for DR.
Use the above steps to setup busybox applicaiton in a new namespace called busybox-test

. Your task is to onboard the sample application from %hub_gitea_console_url%
  * Select github repo : %hub_gitea_console_url%/dev-user/busybox-app.git
  * Branch : main
  * Folder: busybox-odr
. Ensure that its running on primary, test for failover onto secondary and relocate (failback) to primary.
. Just to complicate things a bit `busybox`` namespace is already occupied and so you need to use another namespace like `busybox-app`

  [NOTE] 
  You need to onboard this sample application in a different namespace called `busybox-app`.

=== Some Guidelines to follow :
. *Create the Sample Application using ACM console.* +
Use the sample app example from %hub_gitea_console_url%/dev-user/busybox-app.git to create a deployment in busybox-app namespace for failover and failback testing. This is your own git repo where you can edit and change whatever you need to get the app deployed and works with DR. You can login to this repo with `dev-user` as the username and `openshift` as the password to update the repo contents.
[HINT]
gitea repo - busybox and busybox-example to busybox-app
. *Validate Sample Application deployment.* +
Using CLI commands on managed cluster validate that the application is running.
. *Apply DRPolicy to Sample Application.* +
Use the All Clusters Data Services UI to apply the DRPolicy to this Sample Application. Once applied a DRPlacementControl resource will be created in the application namespace on the Hub cluster.
. *Failover Sample Application to secondary managed cluster.* +
Modify the application DRPlacementControl resource on the Hub Cluster, add the action of Failover and specify the failoverCluster to trigger the failover.
. *Failback Sample Application to primary managed cluster.* +
Modify the application DRPlacementControl resource on the Hub Cluster and change the action to Relocate to trigger a failback to the preferredCluster.
